Setup:

Step 1:
Ensure that you have Deno installed locally. If not, download here: https://deno.com/manual@v1.28.2/getting_started/installation

Step 2:
If Visual Studio Code, install the official extension called 'Deno'.
If other editor see https://deno.com/manual@v1.28.2/getting_started/setup_your_environment

Step 3:
Because the extension does not assume it applies to all workspaces you use with VSCode. To enable your project in Deno you have to run the 'Deno: Initialize Workspace Configuration' command inside the command palette.

Step 4:
You're ready to run the script. Easy peasy lemon sqeezy.
